# G4cgalboolean

The Geant4 boolean processor often fails to compute a resulting mesh. There are other meshing tools available but many suffer
from robustness issues. g4cgalboolean uses [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org) mesh [boolean and refinement](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Polygon_mesh_processing/index.html#Coref_section) to perform boolean operations. CGAL license is not compatible with Geant4 and so is distributed separately from Geant4
