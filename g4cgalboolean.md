# G4cgalboolean

The Geant4 boolean processor often fails to compute a resulting mesh. There are other meshing tools available but many suffer
from robustness issues. g4cgalboolean uses [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org) mesh
[boolean and refinement](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Polygon_mesh_processing/index.html#Coref_section) to perform boolean operations. The
CGAL license is not compatible with Geant4 and so is distributed separately from Geant4.

 * [Source code repository](https://github.com/g4edge/g4cgalboolean)

An virtual base class `G4VBooleanProcessor` can be implemented to provide the
boolean processing functionality. In the case of `g4cgalboolean` this class is called `G4BooleanProcessorCGAL` and Geant4 can be informed to use it via a static method of `G4Boolean` so

```
...
#include "G4BooleanProcessorCGAL.hh"
...

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  G4BooleanSolid::SetExternalBooleanProcessor(new G4BooleanProcessorCGAL());
  ...
  ...```

### Using g4cgalboolean in your project

1. Copy the `src` and `include` code over to your geant4 application (`G4BooleanProcessorCGAL`, `G4SurfaceMeshCGAL` and `G4VSurfaceMesh`)
1. Install CGAL using your package manager 
1. Add CGAL to your `CMakeLists.txt` see example in repo
1. Compile and enjoy
